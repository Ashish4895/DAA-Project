# 📦 Huffman Compression Tool

A Python GUI application for text **compression and decompression** using the **Huffman Coding Algorithm**. Built with `Tkinter` for the user interface and `Matplotlib` for visualizing character frequencies, this tool lets you **compress `.txt` files**, **save/load binary compressed files**, and **decompress them back to the original text**.
